        "overview":"The YES G1000 Plasma Cleaning System is a plasma cleaning system used for the cleaning and low temperature descum of substrates, as well the surface modification and gentle cleaning of inorganic substrates. The use of plasma at a low generation frequency (40 kHz) in substrate cleaning allows for flexibility around cleaning processes, including, for example, the cleaning of electronically sensitive devices. The YES G1000 generates plasma between an active and grounded electrode plate, free electrons, created in the plasma field, are drawn down by the grounded plate allowing only active ions to pass through to clean components; the result is uniform and consistent processing which, as highlighted previously, leaves the electronic properties of cleaned components unchanged."
